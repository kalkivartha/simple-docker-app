## 📦 Docker Compose Setup

This project uses Docker Compose to run both frontend and backend containers simultaneously.

### 🧾 `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  backend:
    image: your_dockerhub_username/simple-docker-app-backend:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"

  frontend:
    image: your_dockerhub_username/simple-docker-app-frontend:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
````

> Replace `your_dockerhub_username` with your actual Docker Hub username.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kalkivartha/docker_sample_code.git
   cd docker_sample_code
   ```

2. **Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed**

   * [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   * [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

3. **Run the containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the services**

   * **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   * **Backend**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🛠️ Notes

* Make sure the backend and frontend Docker images are published to your Docker Hub account before running `docker-compose up`.
* To build your own local images instead, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` to use `build` instead of `image`.
